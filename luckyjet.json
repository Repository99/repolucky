		"description": "<p><strong>Lucky Jet</strong> is a rapidly growing online game. Lucky Jet has become a hit at 1win online casino. Every day more and more players discover Lucky Joe with his backpack in Lucky Jet. Why are more and more players choosing Lucky Jet?</p><h6>Lucky Jet - analogue of Aviator and Crash games</h6><p>Yes, your favorite game is always your favorite, but have you ever had such a situation when the interface of an online game is a little boring and even a little annoying? If you play often, then this is possible. Lucky Jet is the same as Aviator or Crash, but a different interface. Instead of an airplane, you follow Lucky Joe with his backpack. And the rules of the game are the same - place a bet and withdraw money until the moment when Lucky Joe began to gain height.</p><h6>The Lucky Jet's maximum odds is 200</h6><p>Many slot games offer jackpot and bonus games where your potential winnings can be even higher. However, the coefficient of x50, x100 and even x200 is very common in Lucky Jet. The only question is how often. On the forums, players discuss that above x50 happens several times per hour, and more than x150 is usually once in 2-3 hours.</p><h6>You control the game of Lucky Jet</h6><p>Only you decide when to withdraw your money while playing Lucky Jet. Hold and take risks, or withdraw immediately, but with a guarantee of a small win? Very different strategies for different players, but the principle is the same - you decide when to stop and fix the win. Or a loss if luck was not on your side.</p><h6>The Lucky Jet game is adrenaline and excitement in its purest form</h6><p>Perhaps this is the main reason for the popularity of Lucky Jet. It all depends on the case. Decide to wait for the coefficient to increase to x10, and Lucky Joe flew away at the coefficient x5.1? Bad luck. And if you decide to play a little more conservatively and withdraw to x3, you would increase your bet by 3 times. There are many such examples, but the essence is the same - you cannot make a lof of money without luck. On the other hand, play rationally by choosing the correct strategy for playing Lucky Jet for money. Then the role of luck will noticeably decrease, as you follow a certain algorithm of the game.</p>"

		"description": "<p>The first step to winning at Lucky Jet is choosing a strategy and tactics for the game. Playing consciously is the choice of successful players. As an example, we can give two different and even opposite strategies.</p><li><h6>Cautious strategy of playing Lucky Jet</h6><p>The essence of the conservative strategy of the game is to place a bet and withdraw at odds x1.1. In other words, you won't earn much, but it is almost impossible to lose. Sometimes there will be situations when Lucky Joe flies away with the odds x1.05, that is, losing is possible. However, on the forums, you will find ample evidence that, in the end, it is this type of game that brings the winnings and cash to your wallet.</p><p>Among the disadvantages of this strategy, which players are talking about, is a bit boring, because every time you withdraw money at the same coefficient. In this case, it is better to select the autoplay and the withdrawal will occur automatically.</p></li><li><h6>Risky strategy of playing Lucky Jet</h6><p>Risk means expecting a high odds, that is, more than x100. Experienced players know that this ratio occurs every 60-90 minutes, that is, 1-1.5 hours. Look through history and you will see the last time the odds were over 100. Wait 1 hour and start betting big.</p></li><p>Of course, Lucky Jet has strategy options in the middle - not so cautious, but also not so risky strategies of the game. For example, play with a multiplier x2-x3. The chances are about 40% - 45%, that is, even if the bet is lost in the next round, it is possible to win back and even make money.</p><p>In any case, playing Lucky Jet from 1win online casino requires care. First, define your goals and answer the question: Why am I playing Lucky Jet? There are two main answers.</p><h6>The meaning of the game in Lucky Jet</h6><ul><li>For pleasure;</li><li>For money.</li></ul><p>Depending on the answer to this question, decide how to play Lucky Jet. Play for money or for fun is your choice. Good luck with your new game. Great odds and may luck be on your side!</p>"

		"description": "<p>The rules of Lucky Jet are very simple. Before the round starts, players are given time to place their bets on the jetpack. The aim of the game is to choose the right moment and click on the interactive button “Cash out” before Lucky Jet flies away. If this is done correctly, the player’s account will be credited with the winnings in the amount of the bet multiplied by the multiplier when the button is clicked. The maximum size of the multiplier is 5072x. If the player fails to withdraw before the man flies away, the bet is lost.</p><p>Lucky Jet is a game with Proven Integrity. The results of all draws can be checked through the official website. But you need to understand that this is still a game of chance. The probability of winning is influenced by many factors – probability theory, luck, miscalculation of the pattern.</p><p>Lucky Jet is a cash game that is perfectly adapted for all devices. Play from your computer, tablet or phone without compromising your comfort.</p>"

The encrypted version of the server sid is in the public domain until the beginning of the game round. To see it, it is necessary to enter “PROVABLY FAIR settings”, which are located in the user menu. There you can select an existing server sid or create a new one by clicking on the button: “Next server sid SHA512”.</p><p>Here you can also change your client seat. The first 3 players who placed a bet participate in the generation of the client’s sid. A part of the sido is generated on the side of each of these players.

Combined sids generate SHA512 hash, and the generated hash already determines the outcome of a particular round.</p><ul><li>Any player has the right to check the honesty of each round from the history of the game.
